              . Hello! My name is Ricardo Moreira, 25 years old, and I'm a
              self-taught Full-stack developer, from Portugal. Started my
              journey in college, where I started my Informatic Engeneering
              course and learned all the basics of programming. Learned
              languages such as Java, C-Sharp, Javascript and SQL, and before I
              knew it I was at the last year of the course. I then decided to
              drop out of college and pursue on learning tecnologies that are
              dominant on the work market. That's when I started to learn
              ReactJS, NodeJS/Express, Laravel and iOS/Swift.

            <p>
              . I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a
              firm believer that we should never settle.
            </p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid white;" />
            <p>
              . Eventually I got my first opportunity to work professionaly, in
              a software house where I worked for almost two years. I decided
              that I needed a better challenge and that's when I started working
              for BOLD by Devoteam. I worked on the Nearshore department, on a
              Laravel/VueJS project for almost an year.
            </p>
            <p>
              . Besides programming, I have a second passion that is
              photography. I love landscapes, specially beach landscapes, so
              expect most of my pictures to be related to the beach! Neverthless
              I also, travel a lot and I always bring my camera with me. Check
              out my instagram for the latest photos, and give it a follow!
